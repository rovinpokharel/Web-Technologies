      God of War III is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed
      by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. First
      released for the PlayStation 3 on March 16, 2010, it is the fifth
      installment in the God of War series, the seventh chronologically, and the
      sequel to 2007's God of War II. Loosely based on Greek mythology, the game
      is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player
      controls the protagonist Kratos, the former God of War, after his betrayal
      at the hands of his father Zeus, King of the Olympian gods. Reigniting the
      Great War, Kratos ascends Mount Olympus until he is abandoned by the Titan
      Gaia. Guided by Athena's spirit, Kratos battles monsters, gods, and Titans
      in a search for Pandora, without whom he cannot open Pandora's Box, defeat
      Zeus, and end the reign of the Olympian gods to have his revenge.

      The gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on combo-based
      combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary
      weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the
      player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and bosses. The
      player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as
      alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming
      elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a
      revamped magic system, more enemies, new camera angles, and downloadable
      content.

      God of War III was critically acclaimed upon release, with praise for the
      graphics, gameplay, and scope, although the plot received mixed reviews.
      The game received several awards, including "Most Anticipated Game of
      2010" and "Best PS3 Game" at the 2009 and 2010 Spike Video Game Awards,
      respectively, and the "Artistic Achievement" award at the 2011 British
      Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Video Game Awards. The second
      best-selling game in the God of War series and the ninth best-selling
      PlayStation 3 game of all time, it sold nearly 5.2 million copies
      worldwide by June 2012 and was included in the God of War Saga released
      for PlayStation 3 on August 28, 2012. Since its release, it has also been
      named as one of the greatest games of all time. In celebration of the God
      of War franchise's tenth anniversary, a remastered version of the game,
      titled God of War III Remastered, was released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4)
      on July 14, 2015. After two more prequels were released, a direct sequel
      to God of War III simply titled God of War was released on April 20, 2018,
      which shifted the setting to Norse mythology.
