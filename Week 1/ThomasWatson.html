    <h1>Thomas J. Watson</h1>
    <p>
      Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 - June 19, 1956) was an American
      businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM. He oversaw the
      company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson
      developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry
      Patterson's training at NCR. He turned the company into a highly effective
      selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A
      leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time
      and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.

      Charles Ranlett Flint, who had engineered the amalgamation (via stock
      acquisition) forming the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR)
      found it difficult to manage the five companies. He hired Watson as
      general manager on May 1, 1914, when the five companies had about 1,300
      employees. Eleven months later he was made President when court cases
      relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Within four years revenues had
      been doubled to $9 million. In 1924, he renamed CTR to International
      Business Machines. Watson built IBM into such a dominant company that the
      federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952. IBM
      owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating
      machines in the United States at the time. When Watson died in 1956, IBM's
      revenues were $897 million, and the company had 72,500 employees.
